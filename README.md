## Overview and Origin
* **What is Cash App?**

Using Cash App, users can send, receive, request, and invest money peer-to-peer. You can also use it to send and recieve stocks and bitcoin **(TIME)**. 

It makes it easier for one to manage their money without having to go through a bank, which can be time consuming and expensive due to fees. It allows them to access their invesments quickly and efficiently on the go. 

* **When was the company incorporated?**
  
The company was incorporated in October 15, 2013. It was formally known as Square Cash before it was Cash App. (wiki)

* **Who are the founders of the company?**

Cash App founders are Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey.(wiki)

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

 It was created in 2013 during a company hackathon. It was developed with a purpose to make electronic payments between peers simple for things like splitting a bill at a restaurant or separating costs for an AirBnB rental.

The concept of cost splitting was not new given the presence of Venmo as well as Google’s P2P payments functionality. Square’s product was not that sophisticated when it was initially introduced. (fintech takes)

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

 Their income is from users withdrawing funds from the app to their linked bank accounts. (Wiki under finance)

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

> “Our competitors have seen that, and definitely take advantage of the fact that we have a gap specifically in outbound sales,” Dorsey said at the bank’s global technology, media and communications conference. “And we’re figuring out more of a balance there, and not being so stubborn about being technology-first and -focused.” **(NOTE WILL FIX LATER)**

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
 
 Cash App opened its services for it to be tailored to teens. However, both minors and adults can use the app. If a minor gets permission from their parent(s) they can gain access to more Cash App features, such as direct deposit, bitcoin, and stocks. 
 
 Low-income consumers, specifically in the U.S., are likely to use Cash App more than other payment services, such as Venmo. 

According to data from Pew Research Center, which was released in September of 2022, lower-income consumers was twice the share than of upper-income consumers using Cash App in the U.S., specifically by 36% to 18%
