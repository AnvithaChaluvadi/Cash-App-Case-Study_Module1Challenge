By using [Cash App](https://cash.app/), users can send, receive, request, and invest money peer-to-peer for free. In general, it is a mobile payment platform that offers one a convenient and cashless way to handle financial transactions. It creates a financial ecosystem that fosters user engagement. "Cash App is a financial service platform, but not a bank. Bank services are provided by Cash App's bank partners." **(CASH APP)** A user can pay someone by their number, email, or their username ($cashtag). Additionally, they can scan their peer's QR code from the app directly. A user can see their balance automatically update as they make payments to confirm that their transactions have gone through.

Not only is Cash App used for personal transactions, you can also use it to send and receive stocks and bitcoin. **(TIME)** One can purchase stocks using one's funds in their Cash App balance. If there are insufficient funds in their Cash App balance, the remaining balance would be debited from their linked debit card. Additionally, stocks can be scheduled any time of the day (24/7), but would be completed during market hours. You can set up automatic purchases of stock every day, every week, or 2 times a week.**(CASH APP)**

* Jim McKelvey
   * McKelvey co-founded Block Inc. with Dorsey after he had trouble selling a $2,000 art piece from his studio. He also co-founded Twitter alongside Dorsey. He owns 5% of Block and has a net income of $270 million from selling Block shares.
   * As an entrepreneur, he has at least 7 companies that range from a CD cabinet maker to a glass blowing studio


Notable Staff:
* Keith Rabois:
Former COO/VP Engagement & Strategy Cash App


* Tom Kakuei:
Former VP Engineering & Engagement, now EVP Strategic Initiatives for Cash App.



### **<ins>How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?</ins>**

 The idea was created in 2013 during a company hackathon. It was developed with a purpose to make electronic payments between peers simple for things like splitting a bill at a restaurant or separating/sharing costs for an AirBnB rental.

The concept of cost splitting was not new given the presence of Venmo as well as Google’s P2P payments functionality. Square’s product was not that sophisticated when it was initially introduced. **(FINTECH TAKES)**

### **<ins>How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?</ins>**


Their income is derived from users withdrawing funds from the app to their linked bank accounts. **(WIKI UNDER FINANCES)**. Furthermore, Cash App primarily generates revenue by charging fees for transactions specific to businesses and individuals, such as subscription services and selling Bitcoin to customers. They offer 2 types of deposits to their users, which includes standard and instant. **(CASH APP WEBSITE)**


* Standard Deposit:
  * Free and can arrive 1-3 business says to their bank account.


* Instant Deposit:
  * 0.5%-1.75% fee (with a minimum fee of $0.25) and is instant to their debit card. Sending from a credit card would be subject to a 3% fee.


An additional revenue source is through its subscription services, such as Cash Cards. A Cash Card is a physical or digital debit card that allows users to make purchases directly linked to their Cash App balance instead of their bank balance. Cardholders also have the option to add the card to their Apple Wallet. 

<p align="center">

</p>


Cash App's largest revenue generator is its Bitcoin segment. Not only is there a 1% to 4% in what Bitcoin exchanges and individuals pay for Bitcoin, but there is a service fee that is charged for selling Bitcoin to its customers. Cash App is able to generate additional revenue on the exchange it facilitates by factoring these differences into the price it offers its users. **(INVESTOPEDIA)**


Additionally, they received external funding from various investors. They have raised a total of $1.9 billion in funding, "which saw profits rise 27% and 15%, respectively, from a year earlier." **(BBN BLOOMBERG)**

## Business Activities

### **<ins>What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?</ins>**

> “Our competitors have seen that, and definitely take advantage of the fact that we have a gap specifically in outbound sales,” Dorsey said at the bank’s global technology, media and communications conference. “And we’re figuring out more of a balance there, and not being so stubborn about being technology-first and -focused.” **(PAYMENT DIVE)**


Cash App and Block Inc. are expanding efforts to develop services that are more personalized and provide the general population with tools that allow them to make more informed decisions through AI. 

### **<ins>Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?</ins>**
 
 Cash App initially developed its services tailoring it to teen demographic. However, today, minors and adults use the app. If a minor obtains permission from their parent(s), they gain expanded access and use features like direct deposit, bitcoin, and stocks. 
 
 Cash App is also more likely to be used by low-income consumers in the U.S. According to data from Pew Research Center, which was released in September of 2022, lower-income consumers comprised twice the share than of upper-income consumers using Cash App in the U.S., specifically by 36% to 18%. **(PAYMENT DIVE)**

 Additionally, Pew Research Center discovered the usage of users by age group.

* More Likely to use Cash App
 
    * 40% - 18 to 19 year olds
    * 30% - 49 years olds

* Less Likely to use Cash App

    * 19% - 50 to 64 year olds
    * 9% - 65+ years olds 

Cash App is available both in the U.S. and the U.K. When a user sends money between the U.K or the U.S., "Cash App will convert the payment from the origin currency to the destination currency based on the mid-market exchange rate at the time the payment is created" **(TIMES)**

Small businesses and entrepreneurs are another target population that utilize Cash App. They are able to connect with customers by sharing their Cash App QR code, $Cashtag (username), email, or phone number associated with their account. Businesses can be paid instantly through Cash App. A business account, Cash for Business, can be created for free and would not need any hardware to process business payments. However, there is a fee for business transactions. Accounts do not pay fees for instant deposits to a business's checking account. **(TIMES)**

### **<ins>What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)</ins>**


Cash App beats its competitors by encouraging user loyalty and retention through its unique services. It also has a benefit by fostering relationships with its partner retailers, which provide users with exclusive deals and promotions. Overall, its reputation and user trust gives it a competitive edge over other competitors.


**Note:** A user can choose to save money on this platform through the "Money" tab. It allows them to set savings goals and track them.**(TIME)** Additionally, if a user has a Cash Card they can turn on the "Rounds Up" feature and save changes for a their purchase. Essentially, they can purchase items while putting money on the side. **(TIMES)**


### **<ins>Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)</ins>**

Cash App leverages several cutting-edge technologies to provide seamless and a secure user experience.

It utilizes state-of-the-art secure encryption algorithms to protect user data and their financial transactions. Cash App is a PCI Data Security (PCI-DSS) Level 1 compliant, which is the highest level of compliance and payment standards merchants can comply with to securely store, transmit, and process credit card information. **(CASH APP & ALL ABOUT COOKIES)** If users were to use public or private Wi-Fi or data (3G, 4G, etc.), then their data and sensitive information would be protected from unauthorized entities, as that information would be encrypted and sent securely to Cash App’s servers. As added protection, Cash App offers two-factor authentication.  

Not only does Cash App use encryption. It also utilizes cloud computing technology, like Google Cloud, and artificial intelligence (AI) research firm Dessa to strengthen "Cash App's existing solutions and drive innovation mechanisms to improve customer experience and increase accessibility to bank services." **(GOOGLE CLOUD)**. Machine learning (ML) technology can help with the enhancement of products in areas of customer engagement, risk management, and more. By acquiring Dessa, they not only further their machine learning abilities, but improve their products and pass on benefits to customers around the world. They can support the Dessa team and other Square product teams by continuing to hire top ML and AI talent. They also "opted to use Google Cloud AI and machine learning (ML) solutions and NVIDIA's graphic processing units (GPUs) to handle the immense compute demands of its applied AI efforts." Essentially, they would be able to handle the large volume of transactions and user requests, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience. In turn, Block Inc.’s data scientist would be able to conduct data-heavy, processing-intensive initiatives. 

Another technology that Cash App uses is near-field communication (NFC). NFC enables users to make contactless payments by simply tapping their smartphones or their Cash Cards against payment terminals/readers, offering a convenient method for in-person transactions. **(CASHAPP)**
