*“Our competitors have seen that, and definitely take advantage of the fact that we have a gap specifically in outbound sales,” Dorsey said at the bank’s global technology, media and communications conference. “And we’re figuring out more of a balance there, and not being so stubborn about being technology-first and -focused.”* **(NOTE WILL FIX LATER)**

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
 
 Cash App opened its services for it to be tailored to teens. However, both minors and adults can use the app. If a minor gets permission from their parent they can gain access to more Cash App features, such as direct deposit, bitcoin, and stocks.
